# Neural-Machine-Translation-NMT-using-FairSeq-and-OpenNMT
## Abstract
This is a collaborative project on Neural Machine Translation(NMT) by employing two renowned tools(FairSeq, OpenNMT). 
## Preprocessing
The first step was processing, which encompasses utilizing BPE for tokenization(we use the subword-nmt library); moreover, converting all the letters into lowercase. 
## FairSeq
Considering FairSeq, we had to specify some hyperparameters for the model, such as the loss function, optimizer, batch size, and so forth.
Here is the sample output when training the model with the FairSeq tool:
